    "PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "Create a love calculator using Python coding that takes two names (his name and her name) as input \n",
    "and compare each letter present in both the names to see if the letter is present in the word \"True Love\".\n",
    "If present the count would go up by 1 and if not the count remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps used\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "1. Creating a variable with the word 'truelove' to refer to and calculate.\n",
    "2. Create two input options to take two names (his and her) and converting to lower case.\n",
    "3. Create a function that will take two names as a input and then inside the function will be a for-loop\n",
    "that will check how many letters in the names are in the word 'TrueLove' if there is a match the count variable\n",
    "will have an increment of 1 if not then no changes to the count variable\n",
    "4. Finally the function will return the count\n",
    "5. print an output statement displaying the result\n",
